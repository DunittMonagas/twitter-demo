Assumptions and Considerations

For the scope of this challenge, the following assumptions and simplifications have been made:

Testing: Demonstrative unit tests have been included for the main use cases (user, tweet), but 100% coverage is not provided.

Fan-Out Scope: The asynchronous distribution pattern was implemented solely for the tweet.created event as a prototype. In a production system, events like "delete tweet" or "unfollow" should also be emitted to maintain cache consistency.

Database Agnosticism: Although a relational database (PostgreSQL) is used for persistence, the code is decoupled via interfaces, allowing for migration to NoSQL or other engines if data volume requires it.

Security: Security implementations such as password hashing (bcrypt) and authentication (JWT) have been omitted to focus on architecture and scalability patterns. Additionally, sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys) are written in plain text in the configuration files for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, these should be managed using secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets).

Content: The design assumes purely text-based tweets. Multimedia handling would require the integration of Object Storage (S3) and a CDN, components not represented in this diagram.
